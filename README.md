# L_Systems_Laboratory
Unity3D Tool for creating interactive plant assets

Project APIs:
Parametric L-Systems with modules from Physics Movers. Modules need to be programmed to interact with an arbitrary character machine

Character Machine
	-Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) integrated with the Kinematic Character Controller at all levels of the state hierarchy.
	-Workflow for defining a new character - see default character machine

TO-DO:
-PhyiscsLSystem - PhysicsMover
	-Generate interactable leaves and flowers on Helianthus
